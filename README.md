# CAPSTONE PROJECT FOR TELECOM CUSTOMER CHURN
Capstone Project: PROJECT NOTES-I-4
The first set of project notes must describe the data and be aligned to the analytical business problem the Capstone Project addresses. It should also include the rationale of the project (why is the problem important and what value will it add to the company). The submission should be of 7 to 10 pages(but not limited to) containing a simple and straightforward depiction of the objective of the project, description of data, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) report and the insights from EDA.

Below are the guidelines for the Project Notes-I:

Review Parameters	Points
1) Introduction of the business problem	4
a) Defining problem statement	 
b) Need of the study/project	 
c) Understanding business/social opportunity	 
 	 
2)Data Report	
a) Understanding how data was collected in terms of time, frequency and methodology	 
b) Visual inspection of data (rows, columns, descriptive details)	 
c) Understanding of attributes (variable info, renaming if required)	 
 	 
3) Exploratory data analysis	
a) Univariate analysis (distribution and spread for every continuous attribute, distribution of data in categories for categorical ones)	 
b) Bivariate analysis (relationship between different variables , correlations)	 
a) Removal of unwanted variables (if applicable)	 
b) Missing Value treatment (if applicable)	 
d) Outlier treatment (if required)	 
e) Variable transformation (if applicable)	 
f) Addition of new variables (if required)	 
 	 
4) Business insights from EDA 	
a) Is the data unbalanced? If so, what can be done? Please explain in the context of the business	 
b) Any business insights using clustering  (if applicable)	 
c) Any other business insights

he second set of project notes must include the model building aspect and be aligned to the analytical business problem the Capstone Project addresses. It should also include the rationale behind using/building one particular model (if applicable). The notes should be brief and succinct containing the depiction of the results for the models built aligned with the objective of the project. 

Below are the guidelines for the Project Notes-II:

1). Model building and interpretation
a. Build various models (You can choose to build models for either or all of descriptive, predictive or prescriptive purposes)
b. Test your predictive model against the test set using various appropriate performance metrics
c.Interpretation of the model(s)
 
2). Model Tuning and business implication
a. Ensemble modelling (if necessary)
b. Any other model tuning measures (if applicable)
c. Interpretation of the most optimum model and its implication on the business
